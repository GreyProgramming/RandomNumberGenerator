# RandomNumberGenerator

Intro:

The challenge: "Coding a random number generator with Python is another great programming project idea. The goal of the application is to randomly generate a number at the user’s request. This project will test a new developer’s ability to use variants, integers, random function, input/output and other concepts."

In my wednesday night d&d game, I have given one of my players a set of dice which, when rolled, have 1000 random effects. I think I would like to create a randomiser that matches against a table and pulls back the effect that those dice have, which will save me time and remove the risk that the website I use goes down.

step 1: Create a simple program that takes inputs for min and max value and pulls back a random integer between the two.
